## How to Use

### For Admins

```javascript
// 1. Create workflow via dashboard
// http://localhost:3000/sys-cmd-7x9k2/workflows-advanced
// - Click "Create Workflow"
// - Select template or configure sources
// - Click "Create"

// 2. Execute on events
// - Workflow auto-executes on event resolution
// - Or manually trigger via API

// 3. Monitor results
// - View execution history in dashboard
// - Check statistics and success rates
// - Analyze confidence/accuracy trends
```

### For Developers

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_WORKFLOWS } from '@/lib/workflows/WorkflowBuilder';
import { executeVerificationWorkflow } from '@/lib/workflows/UpstashOrchestrator';

// Use pre-configured workflow
const result = await executeVerificationWorkflow(
  'event-123',
  'default_crypto',
  { question: 'Will BTC be above $50K?', category: 'crypto' }
);

// result = {
//   outcome: 'yes' | 'no' | 'uncertain' | 'escalated',
//   confidence: 92,
//   sources: { ... },
//   executionTime: 12500,
//   escalated: false
// }
```
