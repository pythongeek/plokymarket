## How to Execute Next Phases

### Phase 2: Execute Test Trade

**1. Access Market**:
- URL: https://polymarket-bangladesh.vercel.app/markets/2698853e-f9fc-48d4-b9c9-d8663a929a93
- Login or register test user

**2. Place Orders**:
```bash
# Option A: Use UI (recommended)
Click "Place Order" button on market page

# Option B: Use API
curl -X POST https://polymarket-bangladesh.vercel.app/api/orders \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"market_id":"2698853e-f9fc-48d4-b9c9-d8663a929a93","order_type":"limit","side":"buy","outcome":"YES","price":0.55,"quantity":100}'
```

### Phase 3: Verify Matching
```bash
# Check orders
node test-execution.js

# Expected: Should show orders placed
# Orders with matching prices automatically execute
```

### Phase 4: Test Settlement
```bash
# Admin resolves market
curl -X POST https://polymarket-bangladesh.vercel.app/api/admin/markets/resolve \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"market_id":"2698853e-f9fc-48d4-b9c9-d8663a929a93","winning_outcome":"YES"}'

# Wallets automatically updated
```

### Phase 5: Monitor Real-Time
```javascript
// Open browser DevTools Console and paste:
const supabase = window.supabase;
supabase.channel('*')
  .on('postgres_changes', {event: '*'}, (p) => 
    console.log(`${p.table}: ${p.eventType}`, p.new))
  .subscribe();
```

## Key Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Order Matching
```
BUY 100 YES @ 0.55  +  SELL 100 YES @ 0.55
         ↓                      ↓
      OPEN (0/100)          OPEN (0/100)
         ↓                      ↓
      MATCHING ENGINE
         ↓                      ↓
     FILLED (100/100)     FILLED (100/100)
         ↓                      ↓
      TRADE CREATED: 100 @ 0.55
         ↓
    WALLETS UPDATED (auto)
         ↓

```

### Test 2: Partial Fill
```

         ↓
YES holders receive: 1.00 per share

- Verify BUY price ≥ SELL price
- Ensure same outcome (YES or NO)
- Check user has sufficient balance
- See TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md for details

### Wallet Not Updating
**Issue**: Balance doesn't change after trade
**Solution**:
- Refresh page to sync state
- Check RLS policies allow user access
- Verify subscription connected
- Check browser console for errors

### Real-Time Not Working
**Issue**: No updates in console
**Solution**:
- Verify WebSocket connection (DevTools → Network)
- Check Supabase Realtime enabled
- Verify subscription syntax is correct
- See API_TEST_REFERENCE.md for examples
